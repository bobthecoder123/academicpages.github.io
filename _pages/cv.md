 About Me 
 =========
 Hey there, I'm Ishan. I'm in 8th grade. I particpate in a variety of activites, such as [First Lego League](https://www.firstlegoleague.org/),  and tennis. In my free time, I enjoy playing outside, coding, reading, or playing video games. Right now, I mostly play Among Us, and Brawl Stars.
